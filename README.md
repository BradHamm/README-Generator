## Description

For our most recent project, we were asked to create a README generator which automatically formatted user submitted information through the terminal into a comprehensive markdown file for project submissions to Github. Using the inquirer package installed via npm onto a local package.json file, prompts could be given to the user giving clear instructions on what to provide and where the information would be appended inside of the README.md file. The Acceptance Criteria can be found down below for reference:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

Over the course of the project, I learned more about the functionality of asyncrinous functions and .prompt-specific data types through inquirer (see: list-type). Both of which lead to the implementation of section-specific confirmations that the information was appended and simplified the process of appending license badges to a README.

With this new program, it will greatly simplify the README creation for future assignments and introduce consistent QC to my Github repos.

In a future project, I'd like to introduce a more functional way to submit images to the README, without directly copying and pasting the directory path into the description/test/usage sections of the project.
